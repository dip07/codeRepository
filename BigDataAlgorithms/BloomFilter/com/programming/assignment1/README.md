This is a programming assignment that I did in course Algorithm for Large DataSets.
A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not, thus a Bloom filter has a 100% recall rate. 
We use BloomFilter to do basic searching in huge number of documents. BloomFilter is also used in Cassandra(a NoSql database).

.My teammate Gaurav Bhatt is also a collaborator in this assignment.
