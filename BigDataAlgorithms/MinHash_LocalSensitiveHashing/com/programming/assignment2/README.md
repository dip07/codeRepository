This is a programming assignment that I did in course Algorithm for Large DataSets. My teammate Gaurav Bhatt is also a collaborator in this assignment.
Suppose we want to do some searching in huge number of documents. Say we want to search a sentence. Surely we cannot load all the sentences in the memory and check. We create a MinHash for this purpose and use that for getting relevant results in acceptable time.
