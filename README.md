This directory contains all my projects/programs that I have done.
There are several projects that I am planning to upload very soon.

Index and brief description of various projects uploaded till now are:
1. Snake Game: I created a Snake Game in my undergard years. It is written in C and uses Far pointer to access the video                    buffer of the monitor. Features supported are:
                a) Create your own maze
                b) Select your own level
                c) Speed up/down the speed of the snake
                d) Temporarily slow down/speed up the snake
                e) Pause/Resume
                f) Score at the end of the game
                h) Help menu accessible on pressing F1

2. Community Detection Using Seed Set Exapnsion: This is a academic project that I was involved while taking DBMS course at                  ISU. In this project we propose a technique to find overlapping community structures in a network/graph                      using seed set expansion technique. Like any other seed set expansion technique our algorithm also has two                   phases â€“ finding a set of good seeds and expanding the initial seed set to form a community. Specifically, we                 find a set of good seeds based on the degree of connectivity of a node within a graph and then recursively                   grow the seed sets until all the nodes are exhausted or no more growth or improvement is possible.

3. BigDataAlgorithms: In this folder you will get various Algorithm implementation realated to Big Data. All of these were                   done while taking course "Algorithm For Large DataSet" at ISU. The desctiption of various projects you                     will get in the related folder.
