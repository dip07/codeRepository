# Community Detection Using Seed Set Expansion

This is a algorithm for community detection that I have done during my course of DBMS at ISU. 
My teammates were Arjun Bhattacharya( @arjun033 ) and Bijon Bose ( @Bijon90 )

##### The Idea :-
In this project we propose a technique to find overlapping community structures in a network/graph using seed set expansion technique. Like any other seed set expansion technique our algorithm also has two phases â€“ finding a set of good seeds and expanding the initial seed set to form a community. Specifically, we find a set of good seeds based on the degree of connectivity of a node within a graph and then recursively grow the seed sets until all the nodes are exhausted or no more growth or improvement is possible.
